I am a junior researcher who is interested in psychology of language. I recently worked in projects investigating the influence of culture and language on bilinguals’ speech and gesture, language change in third-generation immigrants, and second language tutoring using social robots. My research concerns the intersection of bilingualism, cross-language interactions, and language change. I hold a BA in Psychology with a minor in Linguistics as well as a research master’s degree in Linguistics.

I am currently seeking academic positions, so feel free to reach me via the channels at top right.
