I am interested in psychology of language. Recently I worked in projects investigating the influence of culture and language on bilingualsâ€™ speech and gesture, language change in third-generation immigrants, and second language tutoring using social robots. My most recent work examined whether cognitive mechanisms of bilingualism have a role in the change observed in the Turkish spoken by the Dutch Turks.

In my future projects I would like to apply the computational methods such as analyzing big data or conducting online experiments, because they can enormously contribute to this field of research.
